FORL stands for Feline Odontoclastic Resorptive lesions which is a very common condition in cats. It may be present in up to 75% of cats older than 3 years old.

That name is quite over whelming so lets break it down:
* F = Feline = seen in cats! 
* O = Odontoclastic = Cells that are responsable in resorbing the roots of baby teeth.
* R = Resorptive = The process of something being gradually broken down or removed. 
* L = Lesion = An area of disease

So essentially, FORLs are areas of tooth destruction where the tooth is destroying itself. Most commonly found on the premolars.

## What causes it?
It is not known why exactly these lesions occur. Some theories include:

To better understand some of the possible underlying causes, lets take a look at a diagram of a tooth:

* One of the theories is that periodontal disease (disease affecting the space around the tooth) or poor dental hygiene leads to damage cementum, which then exposes the underlying dentin of the tooth to active odontoclasts, causing the tooth to be destroyed.
* Another theory is that when hard food is bitten, small fractures in the tooth occurs leading to inflammation and exposure of the dentin to odontoclasts. 
* Excessive levels of vitamin D in the diet.


## How do I know if my cat is suffering from FORLs?
It can be hard to notice signs of this in your cat. Behaviors to look out for include:
* Difficulty eating - eg they might drop food out of their mouth and appear to struggle when trying to eat.
* Salivating excessively 
* Bad breath
* Changes in behavior or personality - seems more depressed or lethargic than normal. 
* Weight loss & decreased appetite
* If you have a look at your cat's teeth, you might notice some gingivitis, which is reddening of the gum. This can suggest FORL. In severe cases you might even see the crown of the tooth decaying away. Unfortunately, the only way to properly diagnose FORL is with dental radiographs, these are usually undertaken when your cat comes in for a dental procedure under anaesthetic. Dental radiographs allow proper assessment for FORL by allowing the doctor to evaluate the entire tooth for signs, not just the crown.

## Diagnosing FORL 

As mentioned above, the only way to proper way to diagnose FORL is with a dental procedure under anaesthetic.
While your cat is under anaesthetic your vet will probe all of their teeth (the same way our dentist will do with us). This allows the vet to identify any abnormalities that can be seen or felt.

Secondly, your vet will take full mouth radiographs in order to see and to assess each tooth in its entirety. At this stage, if your vet identifies FORL, they will classify them into 2 different types:
* Type 1 lesions: These are teeth that have evidence of destruction - essentialy it looks like the tooth is disappearing, but not yet to the point where the tooth is being replaced by bone. These type 1 lesions may progress into type 2. 
* Type 2 lesions: These are where the root of the tooth is being replaced by bone. As the osteoclasts (cells that destroy teeth) are killing off the tooth, osteoblasts (cells that make bone) are laying down new bone.
