# Core Vaccines 
The core vaccines include DA2PP (Distemper virus, adenovirus-2, parvovirus and parainfluenza)***** and Rabies. Depending on where you live, leptospirosis may also be considered a core vaccination. For example, in California, leptospirosis is considered to be a core vaccine.

## Rabies
Rabies is a virus spread through the saliva of infected animals. The most common reason for your pet to become infected with rabies through a bite from infected wildlife or another rabid pet. Rabies is also zoonotic, which means if a human is bitten by a rabid animal, they can also become infected with rabies. 

Once an animal becomes infected with rabies there is no treatment. The disease can spend a long time (this can be from 2 weeks to 6 months) hanging out in the tissue where it was innoculated before it travels up the nervous system, into the spinal cord and eventually to the brain. Once it reaches the brain you may start to see signs such as:
* Behavior changes - anxiety, aggression
* Paralysis
* Salivation and difficulty swallowing
* Seizures
* Vocalisation
Eventually the affected animal will die.

If your pet is unvaccinated and is exposed to a rabies suspect - eg was bitten by a potentially rabid wild animal, in most states of the USA, the law requires the pet to be euthanised immediately or to be quarantined for 6 months. 

Vaccinating against rabies is extremely important both for the sake of your pet and to protect you and your family from a deadly and irreversible disease. In the USA rabies vaccination is mandated by law. 

## Distemper 
Distemper is an extremely contagious virus seen in dogs. Your dog can catch the virus from other affected dogs or wildlife when they sneeze or cough, from their mother if she is infected or from sharing food, water and an environment in general with affected animals. 
The body system victims of distemper virus include the respiraotry, digestive and neurological systems. This causes signs such as:
* Discharge coming from the eyes and nose
* Coughing 
* Vomiting
* Neurological signs - these may include strange behaviours such as seizures, circling, salivating, muscle twitching and paralysis. 
* Thickening of the paw pads
Unfortunately, distemper virus often ends in death.

Unfortunately, there is no treatment for distemper virus. If your dog catches it, your vet will only be able to provide supportive care. In the unusual event where your dog makes a recovery, they will very likely be left with permanent neurological damage. It is extremely important to vaccinate all dogs against this disease and ensure their boosters are always up to date. 


## Parvovirus "Parvo"
Parvovirus is a virus that commonly affects young puppies or unvaccinated dogs. It is a highly contagious disease that is spread when infected feces comes into contact with the dog's mouth. Sounds weird, but dogs dogs don't really discriminate what goes in their mouth! The viral particles are extremelely resistant in the environement and even resistant to many disinfectants, meaning it can be very difficult to control. Viral particles can contaminate objects like collars, food bowls and be spread on people's clothing and shoes. 

Once parvovirus infects your dog, it attacks rapidly dividing cells. These cells are found in the intestines, bone marrow. This causes signs such as:
* Vomiting and severe, bloody diarrhoea - due to destruction of cells in the intestines. 
* Decreased white blood cells (these cells are involved in the immune system) - due to destruction of bone marrow.

There is no specific treatment for parvovirus. With intense, supportive veterinary care, it is possible for your dog can make a full recovery from a parvovirus infection. However, this is usually a very expensive process with no certainty of success.

Parvovirus is a common, horrible and potentially fatal disease with no specific treatment. In light of this, every dog should be vaccinated.

## Canine Adenovirus (Canine hepatitis)

Adenovirus is spread between dogs when contaminated saliva, feces or urine come into contact with another dog's mouth. Once infected, the virus spreads in the bloodstream, throughout the body. As well as affecting the blood vessels, the virus also affects the liver, kidneys, spleen and lungs, causing bleeding and damage to these organs.  

A dog infected with adenovirus could show disease in the following ways:
* Sudden death
* Increased redness and/or red dots over the gums - caused by bleeding from small blood vessels. 
* Jaundice - when there is a yellow tinge to the skin, eyes and gums
* Lack of appetite +/- vomiting

Like with the other viruses mentioned, there is no specific treatment, but dogs may recover with supportive veterinary care. 

Sometimes dogs who recover, will have permanently blue looking eyes 'blue eye'. This is caused by the virus forming complexes with the dog's immune system which clog up the draining blood vessels of the eye, resulting in fluid build up in the cornea, the usually transparent outer layer of the eye.

There are two types of adenoviruses - CAV-1 and CAV-2. CAV-1 causes the disease process we just discussed and CAV-2 causes respiratory disease and is classified as one of the viruses implicated in the kennel cough complex. The CAV-2 vaccine is the most comonly used vaccine 9it does not cause blue eye) and provids protection against both CAV-1 and CAV-2. 

Thanks to the CAV vaccine, cases of this disease are not often seen today. Like with the other diseases mentioned it is very improtant that all dogs recieve this vaccine to protect against this potentially fatal disease. 

# Non-core vaccines
The non-core vaccinations are a group of vaccines not considered essential for every pet dog. THey are only required if they fit with your dog's lifestyle.  

## Leptospirosis "lepto"
Leptospirosis is an illness caused by the genus of bacteria: _leptospira_. The bacteria lives in soil water all over the world, but mainly in areas that are warm and humid. 

There are many ways your dog might catch lepto. Your dog is at risk of lepto if they spend time around from water bodies like rivers, lakes and ponds. They can also get it from coming into contact with infected urine, which could be from wildlife or farm animals. They may get it from their mother, if she is infected or through a bite from an infected animal. 

In many areas where lepto is commong, such as in California, it is considered part of the core vaccinations. This is because it is so difficult to characterise whether or not an animal is at risk. Even if a dog never leaves the backyard, it still could be exposed to lepto through contact with rodents or other wildlife. 

If your dog becomes infected with leptospirosis, it can display a variety of different signs:
* some dogs don't show any signs or recover after only showing mild signs. 
* Other dogs can suffer from severe disease resulting in liver and kidney failure. With these dogs you may see jaundice (yellow skin/gums/eyes), vomiting, diarrhoea, changes in urination habits. Blood in the vomit or feces and red dots on the gums caused by uncontrolled bleeding. 

Leptospirosis is treated with supportive care and antibiotics, although it is not always posssible for animals to make a complete recovery. Many animals suffer from permanent liver and/or kidney damage. 

Leptospirosis is a zoonosis, meaning it can be transmitted from your dog to humans. Although this is uncommon, it is still important to be aware of this extra risk.

Leptospirosis can be a very serious disease and combined with its potential to be passed onto humans is why, in areas where the bacteria is common it can be a very good idea to vaccinate against it. Vaccines are available for the most commonly encountered strains of leptospirosis.

Although the leptospirosis vaccine does not protect against all the different types of leptospira bacteria, vaccines have been developed to protect against the most common types. 

## Kennel cough/ canine infectious tracheobronchitis: Bordatella & Parainfluenza

Bordatella and parainfluenza, although separate vaccines, help to control the same disease: Kennel cough aka canine infectious tracheobronchitis. This is why they will be discussed together, if you are vaccinating against one, you should be vaccinating against the other too. 

Kennel cough, as the name suggests is a respiratory tract disease. Canine infecitous tracheobronchitis just means inflammation of the trachea (the big windpipe leading to the lungs) and bronchi (the smaller little pipes the lungs branch into before ending as the alveoli). 

Signs of kennel cough are much like the signs of the flu we would see in humans and may include:
* coughing
* fever
* weight loss and loss of appetite
* discharge from the eyes and nose
it also has the potential to lead to pneumonia. 

LOTs of different pathogens (viruses and bacteria that cause disease) can cause kennel cough like signs and so it is important to remember that even if a dog has been vaccinated, while the risk of disease is reduced, it may not be totally protective.

Your dog should be vaccinated against kennel cough if they have exposure to other dogs (eg on walks, at kennels, dog parks etc). Many kennels or groomers will require a dog to be vaccinated against kennel cough before they are allowed to be boarded. With such a contagious disease, imagine how badly things could go in a kennel if there was an outbreak of such a disease. Imagine you are living in a share house with 5 other people, if you catch the flu, chances are it is only a matter of time before your housemates succum to the same fate! Even though, like the human flu vaccine, it may noto be 100% effective (and no vaccine ever is), I'd much rather get a less bad version of the flu than every one get full blown flu with absolutely no prortection! 

## Canine influenza
Another flu like disease very similar to kennel cough. It is caused by a virus and is highly contagious. It is spread in a very ismilar way to kennel cough and the human flu - through sneezing, coughing and contact with infected animals or with contaminated objects. 

Clinical signs are very similar to kennel cough: coughing, sneezing, runny eyes and nose, fever. There is also the possiblity of further complications such as pneumonia. 

Depending on where you live, your dog may or may not be likely to be exposed to canine influenza. Talk to your local vet to see if vaccinating against influenza is the right choice for your pet.


## Lyme disease
Lyme disease is caused by the bacteria: _Borrelia burgdorferi_.
