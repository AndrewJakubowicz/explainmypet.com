  cavaties"

**FORL** stands for Feline Odontoclastic Resorptive lesions, which is a very common condition in cats. It is also known as feline caries, tooth resorption (TR) or feline cavities. 75% of cats older than 3 years old can develop FORL.

What does FORL mean:

* F = Feline = seen in cats! 
* O = Odontoclastic = Cells that are responsable in resorbing the roots of baby teeth.
* R = Resorptive = The process of something being gradually broken down or removed. 
* L = Lesion = An area of disease

FORLs are areas of tooth destruction where the tooth is destroying itself. Most commonly found on the premolars. These are the teeth between the canines and molars.

## What causes it?

It is not known why these lesions occur. Some theories include:

* Periodontal disease (disease affecting the space around the tooth) or poor dental hygiene leads to damage cementum, which then exposes the underlying dentin of the tooth to active odontoclasts, causing the tooth to be destroyed.
* The idea that cats have not evolved to chew hard foods. When hard food is bitten, "abfracation" injuries occur. These small fractures occur in the root of the tooth leading to inflammation and exposure of the dentin to odontoclasts. 
* It is thought that excessive levels of vitamin D alter the way cementum heals itself, causing it to undergo resorption instead of healing when damaged.

## How do I know if my cat is suffering from FORLs?

It can be hard to notice signs of this in your cat. Lesions that progress to the crown of the tooth are extremely painful (as they are in humans), but cats often don't show any signs. Look out for:

* Difficulty eating - e.g. they might drop food out of their mouth and appear to struggle when trying to eat.
* Excessive salivating
* Bad breath
* Changes in behavior or personality - seems more depressed or lethargic than normal. 
* Weight loss & decreased appetite
* If you have a look at your cat's teeth, you might notice some gingivitis, a reddening of the gum. This can suggest FORL. In severe cases you might even see the crown of the tooth decaying away.

The only way to properly diagnose FORL is with dental radiographs. These are undertaken when your cat comes in for dental procedures under anaesthetic. Dental radiographs allow proper assessment for FORL by allowing the doctor to evaluate the entire tooth for signs, not just the crown.

## Diagnosing FORL

The only proper way to diagnose FORL is with a dental procedure under anaesthetic.


While your cat is under anaesthetic your vet will probe all of their teeth (the same way your dentist does). The vet can identify any abnormalities that are seen or felt.

Secondly, your vet will take full mouth radiographs in order to assess each tooth in its entirety. If your vet identifies FORL, they will classify it into 3 different types:

* Type 1 lesions: These teeth have evidence of destruction - it looks like the tooth is disappearing, but not to the point where the tooth is being replaced by bone. These type 1 lesions may progress into type 2. 
* Type 2 lesions: The root of the tooth is being replaced by bone. As the osteoclasts (cells that destroy teeth) are killing off the tooth, osteoblasts (cells that make bone) are laying down new bone.
* Type 3 lesions are when one root is type 2, but the rest of the tooth is type 1. 

It is important that your vet distinguishes between these two different types of lesions because the treatment for each type is very different!

## How is it treated?

The treatment for the different types of FORL is very different.

* Type 1 lesions: treated by extraction. There is no more source of pain once the tooth is out! 
* Type 2 lesions: as the bone has already grown into the tooth, these can't be extracted as there is no clear boundary between tooth and bone like in type 1 lesions. Instead, the crown of the tooth is amputated and the gingiva is sutured over the top. The resorbing root is left to resorb into the bone, just as it has been doing.
* Type 3 lesions: when there is a combination of type 1 and type 2 lesions, a combination of the treatment is performed. The tooth is sectioned into its different roots, so that each section essentially functions like a 1 root tooth. Then each piece of the tooth is treated based on its type.

In some cases, your vet will not perform a crown amputation. These include if your cat has an infection around the area or if they are FeLV or FIV positive. 

## How can I help to prevent FORL in my cat?

Dental care at home is important in reducing the risk of getting FORL. The best dental hygiene you can provide is with teeth brushing. Alternatively, you can try dental wipes, dental diets or additives to your pet's drinking water.
Excessive bacteria in your cat's mouth can cause inflammation activating the odontoclasts that are responsible for FORL. 

Athough dental care at home can help prevent periodontal disease, FORLs may still occur.
