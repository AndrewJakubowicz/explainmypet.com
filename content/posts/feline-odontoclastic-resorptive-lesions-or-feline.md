FORL stands for Feline Odontoclastic Resorptive lesions which is a very common condition in cats. It may be present in up to 75% of cats older than 3 years old.

That name is quite over whelming so lets break it down:
* F = Feline = seen in cats! 
* O = Odontoclastic = Cells that are responsable in resorbing the roots of baby teeth.
* R = Resorptive = The process of something being gradually broken down or removed. 
* L = Lesion = An area of disease

So essentially, FORLs are areas of tooth destruction where the tooth is destroying itself. Most commonly found on the premolars.

## What causes it?
It is not known why exactly these lesions occur. Some theories include:
* Excessive levels of vitamin D in the diet
* Periodontal disease



## How do I know if my cat is suffering?
Your 

The only way to properly diagnose is with x-rays. 

## What do the affected teeth look like?
