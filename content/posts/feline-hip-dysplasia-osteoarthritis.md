## Which cats are prone?
Purebred cats are more likely to be affected by hip dysplasia, with the msot commonly affected breed being the Maine Coon. Other breeds that are more prone include Persian and Himalayan breeds.


## Why do cats get it?


## What are the signs?
Cats are stoic and tend to mask their pain well. You might notice signs associated with pain such as:
* Reluctance to jump
* Lameness in the hindlimbs
* Reduced activity
* Poor grooming
* Behaviour changes such as increased aggression
* Weight loss & decreased appetite 
* Walking in a crouched position


Age of onset of clinical signs is between 3 months to 3.5 years of age. 

## How do I know if my cat has osteoarthritis?

## What are the treatment options?

### Management at home

* Provide stepped access to heights so your cat doesn't have to make big jumps to access high areas. 
* Ensure litter tray, food and water are in easy to access places.  
* Provide opportunities for activity like playing with laser pointers, providing cat towers and hiding food to encourage foraging. Encouraging your cat to stay active helps to maintain muscle mass around the joints which helps to stabilise them and minimise the pain associated with arthritis. Think of this like physiotherapy. One idea is to feed your cat on a step, so that they have to put weight on their hindlimbs, this builds strength in their back legs without exposing them to excessive impact. 

### Diet
* Feed your cat a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids
* Weight reduction - it is extremely important that your cat is at their ideal body weight to avoid placing excessive, unecessary load on their joints. 
* Glucosamine and chondroitin - The studies investigating the effectiveness of glucosamine and chondroitin are conflicting, with no convincing evidence to back them up. However, andectodal reports of success have been reported 
* Green lipped mussel extract (GLME) is another neutraceutical shown to be of some benefit to dogs with osteoarthritis. 

### Medical therapy 
* NSAIDs: NSAIDs stands for "Non Steroidal Anti-infalmmatory". You may be familiar with one commonly used in humans: ibuprofen. 

NSAIDs are fantastic for osteoarthritis because they reduce both pain and inflammation by blocking the inflammatory pathway. However, the unfortunate thing about this is that they also block some other important pathways, resulting in some undesirable side-effects.

Meloxicam has been shown to be very effective in the controlling chronic pain in cats suffering osteoarthritis. While Meloxicam may be used long-term in other countries,unfortunately, it is not licensed for long term use in cats in the USA. If your cat is on an NSAID like meloxicam long term, they should recieve routine blood tests to monitor their kidney and liver function. THis is so your vet can adjust the dose given accordingly to try to keep your pet's internal organs as safe as possible.

Alternative options to chronic pain management include the use of opioids such as buprenorphine.

Polysulfated Glycosaminoglycans (Adequan, Chondroprotec)
Polysulfated glycosaminoglycans are given as an injection to your pet. They work by reducing inflammation in the joints and increasing the viscosity of joint fluid, providing better cushioning. 

Adverse effects: use of these may inhibit blood clotting, this means that if your pet needs surgery etc, the injections should be temporarily discontinued. It should also not be used along side other drugs (NSAIDs or anticoagulants).

Using medication such as this in cats is extra-label as there is a lack of studies supporting its use.  

## Surgical management

### Femoral head and neck excision
A femoral head and neck excision involves removing the top part of the femur that sits in the hip joint. This removes the source of pain in hip dysplasia and OA entirely. After this procedure, instead of having a bony joint connecting the hindlimbs to the pelvis, the cat's hip muscles are now responsible for supporting the joint instead. 

Possible complications following this procedure include:
* shortening of the limbs
* Limited range of motion in the hip joints

It is thought that lighter animals such as small dogs and cats are likely to have more success with a surgery like this as opposed to thier larger animal counterparts (larger dogs). 

The surgical success of this procedure can be unpredictable. One study showed graded owner satisfaction following this procedure as: 38% good, 20% satisfactory and 42% poor. 

### Total hip replacement
This procedure is exactly what it sounds like: a total replacement of the hip joint using a man-made joint instead. Along the same rationale as the FHNE, this procedure also eliminates the source of pain (OA in the hip joint), but this time rather than removing it and relying only on the surrounding musculature to maintain stability, the joint is replaced with a man-made alternative, hopefully retaining the original stability provided by the bones. 

Studies have reported excellent outcomes with these procedures. In comparison with FNHE, cats will usually function better after a total hip replacement over the FHNE. 

### So should I choose surgical or medical management?
According to the research, it is promising that a cat will respond to medical management alone. You may decide to try medicla management and elect surgical management if the medical is unsuccessful.
