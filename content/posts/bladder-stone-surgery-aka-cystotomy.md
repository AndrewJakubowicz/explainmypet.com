If your pet is suffering from bladder stones that are unable to be dissolved with a special diet or too big to pass, it is likely they will need to have surgery to have these stones removed. In this please explain article, we talk about what bladder stone surgery (or cystotomy) involves and what to expect your pet needs to have one of these procedures. 

There may be other reasons your vet may want to perform a cystotomy too, these could include to take a sample of a mass that has been found in the bladder, to repair congenital defects or to take samples to evaluate reasons why urinary tract infections might be resisting treatment. 

Let's take a hypothetical pet: Delorus the Daschund and talk about what will happen to Delorus when she comes in to get her bladder stones removed.

## The procedure (cystotomy)
1. An incision is made longitudinally along Delorus' tummy, allowing access into her abdominal cavity.   
2. Once the vet finds the bladder, she places moist sponges around it to make sure her urine doesn't leak out where it's not supposed to, {into what we what we call the peritoneal cavity.}
3. Some temporary sutures "stay sutures" are then put in the bladder wall. THe bladder is a slippery organ and this provides some "handles" so that the vet can manipulate it easily and prevent it from slipping away into the abyss of Delorus' abdomen! 
4. Depending on what is available, your vet might now suck all the urine out of the bladder with a needle, or they might cut the bladder open and suck it all out with a surgical suction instrument. This is basically a vaccum cleaner for surgeons. This prevents urine spilling out into the surgical site when it is incised. Just imagine what would happen if you incised a balloon filled with water! This is what we are trying to prevent by emptying the bladder either before or immediately after incising it!
