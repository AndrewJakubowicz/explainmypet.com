If your pet is suffering from bladder stones that are unable to be dissolved with a special diet or too big to pass, it is likely they will need to be surgically removed. In this article, you'll learn what a bladder stone surgery (or cystotomy) involves and `what to expect your pet needs to have one of these procedures`. 

Large bladder stones may not be the only reason your pet might require a cystotomy. Other reasons include:

- Taking a sample of a mass found in the bladder.
- Repairing cogenital defects.
- Taking samples to evaluate why urinary tract infections are resisting treatment.

# The procedure (cystotomy)

>> *__tl;dr:__* We make an incision through your pets tummy to access the bladder. The bladder is incised so that stones can be removed.

1. An incision is made longitudinally along your pet's tummy, allowing access into their abdominal cavity and bladder.

2. Moist sponges are placed around the bladder making sure urine doesn't leak where it's not supposed to (into what we what we call the peritoneal cavity).

3. Some temporary sutures "stay sutures" are then put in the bladder wall. The bladder is slippery and this lets the vet manipulate it safely preventing it from slipping away.

4. The vet must empty the bladder either before or immediately after incising it. Imagine what would happen if you incised a balloon filled with water! Depending on available equiptment, your vet might now suck all the urine out of the bladder with a needle, or cut the bladder open and suck it all out with a surgical suction instrument. This prevents urine spilling out into the surgical site after incision.

5.  Inside the bladder the vet can take a look around, see how the bladder wall looks, and take a sample of it for bacterial culture. Any stones are removed.

>> Often urinary tract infections go hand in hand with stones. The stones should be sent off to a lab for analysis, which will help find a reason for the stones.

6. A catheter is passed down the urinary tract, clearing it out and finding any extra hidden stones. Your pet is now stone free and ready to close up.

7. The bladder is closed in a water-tight manner. There can be no leakage when the animal urinates and the bladder is under the most pressure. The surgeon sutures the bladder with a type of suture material that is unlikely to cause a reaction and dissolves after the bladder has healed.

8. To double check for leaks, the vet fills the bladder with saline (salty water) and seals any leaks with more sutures.

9. Post-operative radiographs should be taken. These make sure all the stones in the bladder and urethera have been removed.

>> Why the radiograph? It can be difficult to see during surgery and the urethera is just a long dark hole thats hard to see inside. The vet will do their best to remove all the stones, but this is an important step gaining a definitive answer on the overall result of the surgery. Believe it or not, leaving stones behind is quite a common thing!

# After the surgery

Your recently stone free pet must stay in the hospital on IV fluids. Giving IV fluids makes them urinate flushing any blood clots that might have occured during surgery out of the system, preventing potential blockages that could occur in the future. Pain medications is given to manage your pet's pain.


## Taking care of your pet post surgery

You are probably going to recieve some pain medication to give to your pet.
Surgery complications are unlikely, but it is important to know the signs of what to look for. Contact your vet or emergency centre if you notice any of:

* Persistent bloody urine
* Leaking from the suture site
* Excessive straining to urinate or unable to urinate
* Puss
