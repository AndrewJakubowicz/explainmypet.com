# Core Vaccines 
The core vaccines include DA2PP and Rabies. Depending on where you live, leptospirosis may also be considered a core vaccination. For example, in California, leptospirosis is considered to be a core vaccine.

## Rabies
Rabies is a virus spread through the saliva of infected animals. Teh most common reason for your pet to become infected with rabies through a bite from infected wildlife or another rabid pet. Rabies is also zoonotic, which means if a human is bitten by a rabid animal, they can also become infected with rabies. 

Once an animal becomes infected with rabies there is no treatment. The disease can spend a long time (this can be from 2 weeks to 6 months) hangning out in the tissue where it was innoculated before it travels up the nervous system, into the spinal cord and eventually to the brain. 

## Distemper 

## Parvovirus

## Adenovirus (Canine hepatitis)

# Non-core vaccines
The non-core vaccinations are those vaccines that are only required if you feel they fit with your dog's lifestyle. 

## Leptospirosis

## Bordatella, Parainfluenza & Canine influenza
