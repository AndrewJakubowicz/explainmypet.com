Treatment of flea allergy dermatitis above all is treating the fleas. While it may seem like it is as simple as applying a flea control product, in reality the problem can be far more difficult to treat. Fleas are a difficult problem to solve, understanding why this is the case requires some knowledge their lifecycle and what kinds of drugs are available to control them. 

## The flea lifecycle
* Fleas begin as eggs. Once laid these eggs fall off your pet and onto the ground. The most prolific time for egg laying is at night - this is why it is so important to thoroughly clean your pets bedding when treating fleas.
