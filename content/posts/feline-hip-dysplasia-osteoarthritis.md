title: Hip dysplasia leading to Osteoarthritis in Cats

Today we'll cover osteoarthritis caused by hip dysplasia.
__Osteoarthritis__ is the degeneration of joint cartilage as well as the bone.
__Hip dysplasia__ is when the hip joint has an abnormal structure, commonly due to genetics.

Osteoarthritis develops slowly due to the joint not working as it should.
Slowly cartilage damage accumulates as well as bone damage.
The cartilage helps the joint move smoothly and acts as shock absorption.
As damage builds up, using the joint becomes extremely painful.

To control the pain associated with osteoarthritis, it should be managed with lifestyle changes paired with medication or salvage surgery.


## Which cat breeds are prone to hip dysplasia?

* Maine Coon (the most prone)
* Persian and Himalayan breeds

Purebred cats are more commonly affected than their mixed counterparts.

## The signs

* Reluctance to jump
* Lameness in the hindlimbs
* Reduced activity
* Poor grooming
* Behavioural changes eg. increased aggression
* Weight loss
* Decreased appetite
* Walking in a crouched position

Remember, your cat will generally try to mask their pain.

These clinical signs tend to appear between 3 months of age to 3.5 years of age.


## What are the treatment options?

### Management at home

Since most cats enjoy being up high, you can help them out with getting there by providing stepped access so they don't have to make big jumps that can be painful on their joints.
Keep the litter tray, food and water in easy to access places.

Your cat should get regular excercise. This could be with laser pointer play, foraging for hidden food and using their cat tower. Activity maintains muscle mass around the joints, helping to stabilise the joint and minimise pain.

An idea is to feed your cat on a step. Therefore they must place some weight on their back legs without exposing them to excessive impact.

### Diet

Changing your cats diet can also help manage the damaging effects of osteoarthritis.

Feeding omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects. Beware if your pet has a bleeding defect or on medications that reduce clotting, as omega-3 fatty acids will also affect clotting.

Glucosamine and Chondroitin have little evidence to back them up, but people have reported success.

Green lipped mussel extract (GLME) may also have benefits, but studies have only been done in dogs.

The diet should gradually get your cat to their ideal body weight.
Reduced body weight reduces the pressure on the joints.

Finally, there are special diets available to help that include some of the above supplements. These include: "Hill's j/d feline" and Royal Canine "Medi-Cal feline mobility support".

### Acupuncture

While there is no solid evidence, acupuncture may help.

### Medical therapy

#### NSAID or "Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs"

NSAIDs reduce pain and inflammation. NSAIDs can have undesirable side-effects with potentially negative effects on the kidney and liver.

The NSAID Meloxicam is very effective in controlling chronic pain in cats suffering osteoarthritis.
Meloxicam is not licensed for long term use in cats in the USA, but may be used in other countries.
If your cat is on long term Meloxicam, their kidney and liver function should be monitored with routing blood tests.
Then your vet can adjust the dose to keep your pet's internal organs as safe as possible.

#### Opioids

Alternative options to chronic pain management include the use of opioids such as buprenorphine. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

#### Polysulfated Glycosaminoglycans (Adequan, Chondroprotec)

Polysulfated glycosaminoglycans are given by injection to your pet. They reduce inflammation in the joints and increase the viscosity of joint fluid, providing better cushioning. 

They may inhibit blood clotting, so temporarily discontinue injections if your pet needs surgery.
Don't use along side NSAIDs or anticoagulants.

In cats there is a lack of studies supporting its use.

### Surgical management


#### Total hip replacement

This surgery replaces the hip joint with a human made joint. The source of pain is removed, and the artificial joint mimics the original joint.

#### Femoral head and neck excision

This is a cheaper alternative to the total hip replacement.

Involves removing the top part of the femur which sits in the hip joint. If a hip joint is a ball and socket, this surgery is the removal of the ball.

Pain is removed, but only muscles are left supporting the joint.

Although excellent outcomes are possible in both procedures, cats are usually better off after a total hip replacement.

### So should I choose surgical or medical management?

Lighter animals such as small dogs and cats are likely to have more success with surgery.

Surgery has risks, and can sometimes go wrong.

It is promising that a cat will respond to medical management alone, leaving surgery as a backup if the medical management fails.
