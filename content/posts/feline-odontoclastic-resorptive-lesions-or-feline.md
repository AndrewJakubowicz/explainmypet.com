FORL stands for Feline Odontoclastic Resorptive lesions which is a very common condition in cats. It is also known as feline caries, tooth resorption (TR) or feline cavities. It may be present in up to 75% of cats older than 3 years old.

That name is quite over whelming so lets break it down:
* F = Feline = seen in cats! 
* O = Odontoclastic = Cells that are responsable in resorbing the roots of baby teeth.
* R = Resorptive = The process of something being gradually broken down or removed. 
* L = Lesion = An area of disease

So essentially, FORLs are areas of tooth destruction where the tooth is destroying itself. Most commonly found on the premolars.

## What causes it?
It is not known why exactly these lesions occur. Some theories include:

To better understand some of the possible underlying causes, lets take a look at a diagram of a tooth:

* One of the theories is that periodontal disease (disease affecting the space around the tooth) or poor dental hygiene leads to damage cementum, which then exposes the underlying dentin of the tooth to active odontoclasts, causing the tooth to be destroyed.
* Another theory is due to the thought that cats are not evolved to chew hard foods. Therefore, when hard food is bitten, "abfracation" injuries occur. THese are small fractures occuring in the root of the tooth which subsequently lead to inflammation and exposure of the dentin to odontoclasts. 
* Excessive levels of vitamin D in the diet. In this theory, it is thought taht with high levels of vitamin D the normal way that cementum heals itself when damaged is altered so that instead of healing itself, it undergoes resorption. 


## How do I know if my cat is suffering from FORLs?
It can be hard to notice signs of this in your cat. Although lesions that progress to the crown of the tooth are extremely painful (as they are in humans), cats often do not show any signs. Behaviors to look out for include:
* Difficulty eating - eg they might drop food out of their mouth and appear to struggle when trying to eat.
* Salivating excessively 
* Bad breath
* Changes in behavior or personality - seems more depressed or lethargic than normal. 
* Weight loss & decreased appetite
* If you have a look at your cat's teeth, you might notice some gingivitis, which is reddening of the gum. This can suggest FORL. In severe cases you might even see the crown of the tooth decaying away. Unfortunately, the only way to properly diagnose FORL is with dental radiographs, these are usually undertaken when your cat comes in for a dental procedure under anaesthetic. Dental radiographs allow proper assessment for FORL by allowing the doctor to evaluate the entire tooth for signs, not just the crown.

## Diagnosing FORL 

As mentioned above, the only way to proper way to diagnose FORL is with a dental procedure under anaesthetic.
While your cat is under anaesthetic your vet will probe all of their teeth (the same way our dentist will do with us). This allows the vet to identify any abnormalities that can be seen or felt.

Secondly, your vet will take full mouth radiographs in order to see and to assess each tooth in its entirety. At this stage, if your vet identifies FORL, they will classify them into 2 different types:
* Type 1 lesions: These are teeth that have evidence of destruction - essentialy it looks like the tooth is disappearing, but not yet to the point where the tooth is being replaced by bone. These type 1 lesions may progress into type 2. 
* Type 2 lesions: These are where the root of the tooth is being replaced by bone. As the osteoclasts (cells that destroy teeth) are killing off the tooth, osteoblasts (cells that make bone) are laying down new bone.
* Type 3 lesions are when one root is type 2, but the rest of the tooth is type 1. 

As you might have guessed, the only way to distinguish between these two types is with x-rays. IF there were no x-rays, you wouldn't be able to see what was happening to the root and whether or not it was being resorbed.  

It is important that your vet distinguishes between these two different types of lesions because the treatment for each type is very different! Read on! 

## How is it treated?

The treatment for the different types of FORL is very different.

* Type 1 lesions: these are treated by extraction. Once the tooth is out, there is no more source of pain! 
* Type 2 lesions: since the bone has already grown into the tooth, these are not able to be extracted as there is no clear boundary between tooth and bone like in type 1 lesions. Instead, to fix these lesions the crown of the tooth is amputated and the gingiva is sutured over the top. The resorbing root is left to resorb into the bone, just the way it has been doing. 
* Type 3 lesions: when there is a combination of type 1 and type 2 lesions, a combination of the treatment is performed. The tooth is sectioned into its different roots, so that each section essentially functions like a 1 root tooth. When a FORL tooth is treated like this, it means the root that is type 2 can have its crown amputated, while the remaining root(s) can be treated for type 1 lesions and extracted. 

In some cases, your vet will not perform a crown amputation. These include if your cat has infection around the area or if they are FeLV or FIV positive. 

## How can I help to prevent FORL in my cat?
* Dental care at home is important in reducing the risk of getting FORL. The best dental hygiene you can provide is with teeth brushing. Alternatively, you can try dental wipes, dental diets or additives to your pet's drinking water.
Excessive bacteria in your cat's mouth can cause inflammation which activate the odontoclasts that are responsible for FORL. 

Unfortunately, that although dental care at home can help to prevent periodontal disease, that may cause FORLs sometimes they can simply not be prevented.
