Vaccinations can be overwhleming, there a lot of them, and you need to decide which non-core vaccines you want. What exactly are the diseases you're vaccinating your pooch against, and how do you decide which of the optional ones fit your dog's lifestyle?

# Core Vaccines

The core vaccines are the DA2PP vaccine and the Rabies vaccine. The DA2PP vaccine protects against: Distemper virus, adenovirus-2, parvovirus and parainfluenza. Each of these diseases is explained below. Leptospirosis may also be considered a core vaccination based on your location. For example, leptospirosis is a core vaccine in California.

Below we'll cover each disease, how it spreads and the effect it could have on your dog.

## Rabies

Rabies is a virus spread through the saliva of infected animals.
A common reason for your pet to become infected is through a bite from infected wildlife or another rabid pet.
You can also get rabies if you're bitten.


There is no treatment once your pet has rabies.
The disease can spend 2 weeks to 6 months without any signs. 
Then it travels into the spinal cord and eventually to the brain.
Once it reaches the brain you may see:

* Behavioral changes like anxiety or aggression
* Paralysis
* Salivation and difficulty swallowing
* Seizures
* Vocalisation

Eventually the affected animal will die.

If your pet is unvaccinated and exposed to a rabies suspect, most states require the pet to be euthanised immediately or to be quarantined for 6 months. This means if your pet gets bitten by wildlife that may have rabies, drastic measures must be taken if there is no rabies vaccination.

Rabies protects your pet and family from a deadly and irreversible disease.
In the USA the rabies vaccination is mandated by law. 

## Distemper

Distemper is an extremely contagious virus seen in dogs.
Your dog can catch the virus from:

* Other dogs and wildlife when they sneeze or cough
* Their mother if she is infected
* Sharing food, water and the environment with infected animals.

Distemper virus infects the respiratory, digestive and neurological systems, causing:

* Discharge coming from the eyes and nose
* Coughing 
* Vomiting
* Neurological signs - such as seizures, circling, salivating, muscle twitching and paralysis. 
* Thickening of the paw pads


There is no treatment for distemper virus and often it ends in death.

Your vet will only be able to provide supportive care.
In the unusual event where your dog makes a recovery, they'll likely be left with permanent neurological damage.


Vaccinate all dogs against this disease and ensure their boosters are always up to date. 


## Parvovirus or _Parvo_

Parvovirus is a virus that commonly affects young puppies or unvaccinated dogs.
It's highly contagious and is spread when infected feces comes into contact with your dog's mouth.
The infectious viral particles are extremely resistant to disinfectants and the environment, surviving a very long time.
In this time the virus spreads onto collars, food bowls, your clothes and shoes.

When parvovirus infects your dog, it attacks rapidly dividing cells.
These cells are found in the intestines and bone marrow causing:

* Vomiting and severe, bloody diarrhoea
* Decreased white blood cells the cells that are required by your dog's immune system

There is no specific treatment for parvovirus.
With intense supportive veterinary care, it is possible your dog can make a full recovery.
This is usually a very expensive process with no certainty of success.

Parvovirus is a common, horrible and potentially fatal disease with no specific treatment. 


## Canine Adenovirus or _(Canine hepatitis)_

Adenovirus is spread between dogs when contaminated saliva, feces or urine come into contact with another dog's mouth. Once infected, the virus spreads in the bloodstream, throughout the body. It affects the blood vessels, liver, kidneys, spleen and lungs, causing bleeding and damage to these organs.  

A dog infected with adenovirus shows:

* Sudden death
* Increased redness and/or red dots over the gums - caused by bleeding from small blood vessels.
* Jaundice - which is a yellow tinge to the skin, eyes and gums.
* Lack of appetite and/or vomiting

There is no specific treatment, but dogs may recover with supportive veterinary care. 

Dogs who recover, may have 'blue eye' and permanently blue looking eyes.
Caused by fluid build up in the cornea, the usually transparent outer layer of the eye due to clogging of the draining blood vessels of the eye.

There are two types of adenoviruses: CAV-1 and CAV-2. CAV-1 causes the disease process just discussed while CAV-2 causes respiratory disease and is one of the viruses implicated in the kennel cough complex. The CAV-2 vaccine is the most comonly used vaccine (it doesn't cause blue eye) providing protection against both CAV-1 and CAV-2. 

Thanks to the CAV vaccine, cases of this disease are not often seen today.
Like with the other diseases mentioned it is very important that all dogs recieve this vaccine to protect against this potentially fatal disease. 



# Non-core vaccines

Non-core vaccinations are a group of vaccines not considered essential for every pet dog. They are only required based on your dog's lifestyle.


## Leptospirosis or _lepto_

Leptospirosis is an illness caused by the genus of bacteria: _leptospira_. This bacteria lives in soil water all over the world, especially in warm and humid areas. 

Your dog is at risk of lepto if they spend time around rivers, lakes and ponds. They can also get it from wildlifes' or farm animals' infected urine, or from a bite.

In many areas where lepto is common, such as in California, it is considered part of the core vaccinations.
This is because it is so difficult to know whether or not your dog is at risk.
Even if your dog never leaves the backyard, they could be exposed through contact with rodents or other wildlife.

If your dog becomes infected with leptospirosis, they can display a variety of different signs:

* some dogs don't show any signs or recover after only showing mild signs. 
* Other dogs can suffer liver and kidney failure. These dogs may have:
    - Jaundice (yellow skin/gums/eyes), vomiting, diarrhoea, changes in urination habits.
    - Blood in the vomit or feces and red dots on the gums caused by uncontrolled bleeding. 


Leptospirosis is treated with supportive care and antibiotics.
It is not always posssible for animals to make a complete recovery.
Many animals suffer from permanent liver and/or kidney damage. 


Leptospirosis can also infect you!
Although uncommon, you should be aware of this risk.

Leptospirosis can be a very serious disease, and its potential to be passed onto humans makes it a good idea to vaccinate against it if the bacteria is common.
Vaccines are available for most commonly encountered strains of leptospirosis.

The leptospirosis vaccines have been developed to protect against the most common types. 


## Kennel cough and Canine Infectious Tracheobronchitis: Bordatella & Parainfluenza

Bordatella and parainfluenza, although separate vaccines, help control the same disease: "Kennel cough" or "canine infectious tracheobronchitis".
If you are vaccinating against one, you should also vaccinate against the other. 

Kennel cough is inflammation of the trachea (the big windpipe leading to the lungs) and bronchi (the smaller little pipes the lungs branch into before ending as alveoli).

Signs are much like the signs of the flu we see in humans and may include:

* coughing
* fever
* weight loss and loss of appetite
* discharge from the eyes and nose

Kennel cough has the potential to lead to pneumonia.

Lots of different pathogens (viruses and bacteria that cause disease) can cause kennel cough signs.
A vaccinated dog has a reduced risk of disease, but complete protection isn't possible.


Vaccinated your dog against kennel cough if they have exposure to other dogs (on walks, at kennels, dog parks etc).
Many kennels or groomers require a dog to be vaccinated against kennel cough before they are allowed to be boarded.
With such a contagious disease, imagine how badly things go in a kennel if there is an outbreak.

Imagine you're living in a house with 5 other people. If someone catches the flu, chances are it is only a matter of time beforethe rest of you catch it too! Like the human flu vaccine, it's not 100% effective (and no vaccine ever is).
Shouldn't your pet suffer a less bad version of the kennel cough than full blown kennel cough with absolutely no protection! 

## Canine influenza
Canine influenza is another flu like disease similar to kennel cough. It's caused by a virus and is highly contagious. It's spread similarly to kennel cough and the human flu:

* Sneezing
* Coughing
* Contact with infected animals or objects

Clinical signs are also similar with your dog showing coughing, sneezing, runny eyes and nose, and fever. Again pneumonia can develop. 

Your dog may or may not be likely to be exposed to canine influenza based on location.
Your local vet  can tell you if vaccinating against influenza is the right choice for your pet.


## Lyme disease

Lyme disease is caused by the bacteria: _Borrelia burgdorferi_.
Your dog can get lyme disease through a tick bite, most commonly the deer tick. 

If you live where lyme disease is found and your dog has access to regions where there may be ticks, consider vaccinating your dog against lyme disease.
Talk to your local veterinarian to find out if a lyme disease vaccine is a good decision.

Unlike in humans, dogs rarely develop the characteristic bullseye type rash. Instead, the signs of lyme disease include:

* Intermittent lameness that keeps recurring 
* Fever
* Swollen lymph nodes
* Hot and painful joints 
* Renal failure - usually fatal

Lyme disease is treated with a course of antibiotics.
Chronic disease in dogs is rare.

You cannot catch lyme disease directly from your dog. To be infected you must be bitten by a tick carrying the bacteria. The only risk your dog poses is by serving as a source of ticks if they bring them in on their coat. 


## Rattlesnake _(crotalus atrox)_

Although called a vaccine, this vaccination should not be considered full protection against rattlesnake bites.
It's purpose is to prolong the effect of rattlesnake venom, allowing you time to seek emergency veterinary care for your dog.
Getting bitten by a rattlesnake is still considered a veterinary emergency! Even after your dog has been vaccinated.

Consider vaccinating your pet against rattlesnake venom if you:

* Live in an area where snakes are common
* Your dog is at a fairly high risk of getting bitten
* you live far away from veterinary care and need extra time.

The rattlesnake vaccine is only intended to give time and will not protect against the venom.
