# Core Vaccines 
The core vaccines include DA2PP and Rabies. Depending on where you live, leptospirosis may also be considered a core vaccination. For example, in California, leptospirosis is considered to be a core vaccine.

## Rabies
Rabies is a virus spread through the saliva of infected animals. The most common reason for your pet to become infected with rabies through a bite from infected wildlife or another rabid pet. Rabies is also zoonotic, which means if a human is bitten by a rabid animal, they can also become infected with rabies. 

Once an animal becomes infected with rabies there is no treatment. The disease can spend a long time (this can be from 2 weeks to 6 months) hanging out in the tissue where it was innoculated before it travels up the nervous system, into the spinal cord and eventually to the brain. Once it reaches the brain you may start to see signs such as:
* Behavior changes - anxiety, aggression
* Paralysis
* Salivation and difficulty swallowing
* Seizures
* Vocalisation

If your pet is unvaccinated and is exposed to a rabies suspect - eg was bitten by a potentially rabid wild animal, in most states of the USA, the law requires the pet to be euthanised immediately or to be quarantined for 6 months. 

Vaccinating against rabies is extremely important both for the sake of your pet and to protect you and your family from a deadly and irreversible disease. In the USA rabies vaccination is mandated by law.
