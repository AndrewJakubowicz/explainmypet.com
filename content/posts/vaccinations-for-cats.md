## Core Vaccinines 
The core vaccination schedule for cats include three diseases plus rabies if you live in a rabies endemic country. You may hear the core feline vaccinations called F3, which is pretty self explanatory, it basically stands for 3 vaccines! Or you may hear it called FVRCP, which stands for Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis, Calivivirus and Panleukopenia. 

### Feline rhinotracheitis or feline herpesvirus (FHV-1)

### Feline Paneleukopenia Virus or FPV

### Calicivirus 

### Rabies

## Additional vaccines
Additional vaccines are only considered if your cat spends time outdoors or if it lives in a household where other cats spend time outdoors. Lets take a look at 

### Feline leukemia virus or FeLV
It is recommended that all young cats less than a year should be vaccinated for FeLV and boostered 1 year later. At this time the need for vaccination based on lifestyle can be reassessed. 

### Feline immunodeficiency virus or FIV

### Chlamydophila felis

### Bordatella bronchiseptica

### Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP)
