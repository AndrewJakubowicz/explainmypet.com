title: Hip dysplasia leading to Osteoarthritis in Cats

Today we'll cover osteoarthritis caused by hip dysplasia.
__Osteoarthritis__ is the degeneration of joint cartilage as well as the bone.
__Hip dysplasia__ is a failure for the hip joint to develop properly.

Osteoarthritis develops slowly due to the joint not working as it should.
Slowly cartilage damage accumulates as well as bone damage.
The cartilage helps the joint move smoothly and acts as shock absorption.
As damage builds up, more damage is caused, and using the joint becomes extremely painful.

The osteoarthritis must be managed with medication, or salvaged through surgery.


## Which cat breeds are prone to hip dysplasia?

* Maine Coon (the most prone)
* Persian and Himalayan breeds

Purebred cats are more commonly affected than their mixed counterparts.

## The signs

* Reluctance to jump
* Lameness in the hindlimbs
* Reduced activity
* Poor grooming
* Behavioural changes, like increased aggression
* Weight loss
* Decreased appetite
* Walking in a crouched position

Remember, your cat will generally try to mask their pain.

These clinical signs tend to appear between 3 months of age to 3.5 years of age.


## What are the treatment options?

### Management at home

Your cat should maintain a moderatively active lifestyle, with high hip stress activities reduced.

Your cat shouldn't be jumping to high places, with preferable stepped access.
The litter tray, food and water must be easy to access.

Your cat should still participate in laser pointer play, playing in the cat tower and foraging for hidden food. Activity maintains muscle mass around the joints, stabilising the joint and minimising pain.

An idea is to feed your cat on a step. Therefore they must place some weight on their back legs without exposing them to excessive impact.

### Diet

Changing your cats diet can also help manage the damaging effects of osteoarthritis.

Feeding omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects. Beware if your pet has a bleeding defect or on medications that reduce clotting, as omega-3 fatty acids will also affect clotting.

Glucosamine and Chondroitin have little evidence to back them up, but people have reported success.

Green lipped mussel extract (GLME) may also have benefits, but studies have only been done in dogs.

The diet should gradually get your cat to their ideal body weight.
Reduced body weight reduces the pressure on the joints.

Finally, there are special diets available to help that include some of the above supplements. These include: "Hill's j/d feline" and Royal Canine "Medi-Cal feline mobility support".

### Acupuncture

While there is no solid evidence, acupuncture may help.

### Medical therapy

#### NSAID or "Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs"

NSAIDs reduce pain and inflammation. NSAIDs can have undesirable side-effects with potentially negative effects on the kidney and liver.

The NSAID Meloxicam is very effective in controlling chronic pain in cats suffering osteoarthritis.
Meloxicam is not licensed for long term use in cats in the USA, but may be used in other countries.
If your cat is on long term Meloxicam, their kidney and liver function should be monitored with routing blood tests.
Then your vet can adjust the dose to keep your pet's internal organs as safe as possible.

#### Opioids

Alternative options to chronic pain management include the use of opioids such as buprenorphine. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

#### Polysulfated Glycosaminoglycans (Adequan, Chondroprotec)

Polysulfated glycosaminoglycans are given by injection to your pet. They reduce inflammation in the joints and increase the viscosity of joint fluid, providing better cushioning. 

They may inhibit blood clotting, so temporarily discontinue injections if your pet needs surgery.
Don't use along side NSAIDs or anticoagulants.

In cats there is a lack of studies supporting its use.

### Surgical management


#### Total hip replacement

This surgery replaces the hip joint with a human made joint. The source of pain is removed, and the artificial joint should mimic the original bones.

#### Femoral head and neck excision

This involves removing the top part of the femur which sits in the hip joint. If a hip joint is a ball and socket, this is the removal of the ball.

This removes the pain, but leaves the cat requiring only muscles to support the joint.

It is thought that lighter animals such as small dogs and cats are likely to have more success with a surgery like this as opposed to their larger animal counterparts (larger dogs). 

The surgical success of this procedure can be unpredictable. One study showed graded owner satisfaction following this procedure as: 38% good, 20% satisfactory and 42% poor. 


Studies have reported excellent outcomes with these procedures. In comparison with FNHE, cats will usually function better after a total hip replacement over the FHNE. 



Possible complications following this procedure include:
* shortening of the limbs
* Limited range of motion in the hip joints

### So should I choose surgical or medical management?



According to the research, it is promising that a cat will respond to medical management alone. You may decide to try medicla management and elect surgical management if the medical is unsuccessful.
