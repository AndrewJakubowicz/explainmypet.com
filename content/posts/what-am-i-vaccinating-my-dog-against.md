# Core Vaccines 
The core vaccines include DA2PP (Distemper virus, adenovirus-2, parvovirus and parainfluenza)***** and Rabies. Depending on where you live, leptospirosis may also be considered a core vaccination. For example, in California, leptospirosis is considered to be a core vaccine.

## Rabies
Rabies is a virus spread through the saliva of infected animals. The most common reason for your pet to become infected with rabies through a bite from infected wildlife or another rabid pet. Rabies is also zoonotic, which means if a human is bitten by a rabid animal, they can also become infected with rabies. 

Once an animal becomes infected with rabies there is no treatment. The disease can spend a long time (this can be from 2 weeks to 6 months) hanging out in the tissue where it was innoculated before it travels up the nervous system, into the spinal cord and eventually to the brain. Once it reaches the brain you may start to see signs such as:
* Behavior changes - anxiety, aggression
* Paralysis
* Salivation and difficulty swallowing
* Seizures
* Vocalisation
Eventually the affected animal will die.

If your pet is unvaccinated and is exposed to a rabies suspect - eg was bitten by a potentially rabid wild animal, in most states of the USA, the law requires the pet to be euthanised immediately or to be quarantined for 6 months. 

Vaccinating against rabies is extremely important both for the sake of your pet and to protect you and your family from a deadly and irreversible disease. In the USA rabies vaccination is mandated by law. 

## Distemper 
Distemper is an extremely contagious virus seen in dogs. Your dog can catch the virus from other affected dogs or wildlife when they sneeze or cough, from their mother if she is infected or from sharing food, water and an environment in general with affected animals. 
The body system victims of distemper virus include the respiraotry, digestive and neurological systems. This causes signs such as:
* Discharge coming from the eyes and nose
* Coughing 
* Vomiting
* Neurological signs - these may include strange behaviours such as seizures, circling, salivating, muscle twitching and paralysis. 
* Thickening of the paw pads
Unfortunately, distemper virus often ends in death.

Unfortunately, there is no treatment for distemper virus. If your dog catches it, your vet will only be able to provide supportive care. In the unusual event where your dog makes a recovery, they will very likely be left with permanent neurological damage. It is extremely important to vaccinate all dogs against this disease and ensure their boosters are always up to date. 


## Parvovirus "Parvo"
Parvovirus is a virus that commonly affects young puppies or unvaccinated dogs. It is a highly contagious disease that is spread when infected feces comes into contact with the dog's mouth. Sounds weird, but dogs dogs don't really discriminate what goes in their mouth! The viral particles are extremelely resistant in the environement and even resistant to many disinfectants, meaning it can be very difficult to control. Viral particles can contaminate objects like collars, food bowls and be spread on people's clothing and shoes. 

Once parvovirus infects your dog, it attacks rapidly dividing cells. These cells are found in the intestines, bone marrow. This causes signs such as:
* Vomiting and severe, bloody diarrhoea - due to destruction of cells in the intestines. 
* Decreased white blood cells (these cells are involved in the immune system) - due to destruction of bone marrow.

There is no specific treatment for parvovirus. With intense, supportive veterinary care, it is possible for your dog can make a full recovery from a parvovirus infection. However, this is usually a very expensive process with no certainty of success.

Parvovirus is a common, horrible and potentially fatal disease with no specific treatment. In light of this, every dog should be vaccinated.

## Canine Adenovirus type 2(Canine hepatitis)



# Non-core vaccines
The non-core vaccinations are those vaccines that are only required if you feel they fit with your dog's lifestyle. 

## Leptospirosis

## Kennel cough/ canine infectious tracheobronchitis: Bordatella & Parainfluenza

## Canine influenza

## Lyme disease

## Rattlesnake
