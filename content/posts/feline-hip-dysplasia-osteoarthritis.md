## Which cats are prone?
Purebred cats are more likely to be affected by hip dysplasia, with the msot commonly affected breed being the Maine Coon. Other breeds that are more prone include Persian and Himalayan breeds.


## Why do cats get it?


## What are the signs?
Cats are stoic and tend to mask their pain well. You might notice signs associated with pain such as:
* Reluctance to jump
* Lameness in the hindlimbs
* Reduced activity
* Poor grooming
* Behaviour changes such as increased aggression
* Weight loss & decreased appetite 
* Walking in a crouched position


Age of onset of clinical signs is between 3 months to 3.5 years of age. 

## How do I know if my cat has osteoarthritis?

## What are the treatment options?

### Management at home

* Provide stepped access to heights so your cat doesn't have to make big jumps to access high areas. 
* Ensure litter tray, food and water are in easy to access places.  
* Provide opportunities for activity like playing with laser pointers, providing cat towers and hiding food to encourage foraging. Encouraging your cat to stay active helps to maintain muscle mass around the joints which helps to stabilise them and minimise the pain associated with arthritis. Think of this like physiotherapy. One idea is to feed your cat on a step, so that they have to put weight on their hindlimbs, this builds strength in their back legs without exposing them to excessive impact. 

### Diet
* Feed your cat a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids
* Weight reduction - it is extremely important that your cat is at their ideal body weight to avoid placing excessive, unecessary load on their joints. 
* Glucosamine and chondroitin - The studies investigating the effectiveness of glucosamine and chondroitin are conflicting, with no convincing evidence to back them up. However, andectodal reports of success have been reported 
* Green lipped mussel extract (GLME) is another neutraceutical shown to be of some benefit to dogs with osteoarthritis. 

### Medical therapy 
* NSAIDs: NSAIDs stands for "Non Steroidal Anti-infalmmatory". You may be familiar with one commonly used in humans: ibuprofen. 

NSAIDs are fantastic for osteoarthritis because they reduce both pain and inflammation by
